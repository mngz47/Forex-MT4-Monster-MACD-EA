Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD): What Is It?
The relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the price of a securities is displayed by the trend-following momentum indicator known as moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D). The 26-period EMA is subtracted from the 12-period EMA to calculate the MACD line.

Since candlestick charts show the open, high, low, and close values in the context of up or down sessions, they aid in the better visualization of price movements and are popular among traders.

Price activity can be graphically analyzed using candlestick patterns such the Harami cross, engulfing pattern, and three white soldiers. Many more candlestick formations can be created based on price activity to predict what will happen next. Other chart formats, such as point-and-figure charts, box charts, box plots, and others, can use the same forms.

Use on USDJPY D1 as seen on screenshots.
